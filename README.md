Pro ReadMe Creator

In this challenge I created a index.js file using inquirer and node.js to create an app that produces a structured ReamMe file based on the input of the user. The structure includes a table of contents and a badge for the license/licenses chosen as well as the title,contributors,installation requirments,etc.
